(Postscript: This post started with a very different title: "The entire group was plotting to kill my PC out of jealousy." In the course of writing the post, however, I was able to see that the group wasn't the RPG Horror Story; I was. Read on and I think you'll agree.) After graduating college about 15 years ago, I made some new friends at church, and was invited by one of them to join his gaming group. I played 3.5 daily for a few years in college (with a single The PW is finally bored of me so this week you’re going to get some real opinions. This week on Skeedap Hates On Everyone we’re going to talk about why Pittsburgh should not have won against the Renegades, and why Space Station Gaming (SSG) might still fail. Even better than that we’re going to have stupid titles for every section. YAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!! # Battle of the Shirts Jerseys versus t-shirts. Pittsburgh Knights (PK) versus Detroit Renegades (RNG). A Look Back at BBL08 I recommend getting comfortable, this is a bit of a read The day is here. The BBL08 is finally ending. And of course, it’s the fucking Melbourne Derby, or the Glenn Maxwell Cup as I like to call it (yes he used to play for us, look it up). More on the final later on. And I deeply apologise in advance for the gross amount of grammatical and formatting errors I almost certainly made while writing this piece. 59 games in 60 days, which was supposed to be the great. # # RECENT UPDATES - WANT TITLES AT BOTTOM GIRL IN THE SPIDERS WEB HD MA GIRL IN THE SPIDERS WEB SD MA NUTCRACKER AND THE FOUR REALS HD MA NUTCRACKER AND THE FOUR REALMS HD - GOOGLE PLAY - MA American Renegades HD Dredd - iTunes 4K Ender's Game - iTunes 4K Fifty Shades Freed - 4K UHD Justice League - 4K UHD - MA Kong Skull Island - 4K UHD - MA Mission Impossible Fallout - iTunes 4K # # LAST WEEKS TITLES I Feel Pretty - iTunes \ The Emoji Movie # # RECENT UPDATES - WANT TITLES AT BOTTOM American Renegades HD - redeems tues Dredd - iTunes 4K Ender's Game - iTunes 4K Fifty Shades Freed - 4K UHD The House with a Clock in its Walls - 4K UHD Justice League - 4K UHD - MA Kong Skull Island - 4K UHD - MA Mission Impossible Fallout - 4K VUDU UHD Mission Impossible Fallout - iTunes 4K Ready Player One - 4K UHD - MA # # LAST WEEKS TITLES \ I Feel Pretty - iTunes \ The Emoji Movie - Vudu HDX or \ \ (MA)\ The great beast was cold. Frost clung to its flanks, biting deep despite the layers of protective chitin and blubbery fat. At the edges of its vast consciousness, cells of its being were dying, one by one, the chill of the void eating into them and claiming them. Each one that died hurt the beast, a series of sharp, painful bursts of discomfort that carried on and on in a constant barrage of sensory stimuli.

 I strongly believe that to understand how each type views the world, you look at the art they make and swear by. You can think of r/MBTIRadioStation as a place to broadcast, type and discuss music, podcasts, videos or whatever you are watching. The goal is to create a directory but you can discuss anything Art, Science, Psychology there. I think musicians and artists explore a lot of their psyche and shadow through their art. Art is the greatest healer and smashes some stereotypes!

I'll reply w/ everything that's beyond character limit. # Weapons # Abide the Return (https://light.gg/db/items/1644160541/) Legendary Sword "It is what she asks of us." —Paladin Kamala Rior > Kamala Rior climbs onto a railing at the top of the Tower in the Last City.

My group is very detail oriented, and so whenever they find a significant library, I try to prep a couple books. Some of these speak to specific PCs in my party, others serve to link the aarakocra lore more tightly to Chult's lore, others are generally useful for adventurers, others reinterpret older edition lore into something tighter / more thematic, and still others provide nice little hints and foreshado. 
This is my third list for this sub. I hope you enjoy it. ART THIEVES, FORGERS, SMUGGLERS. The Art of the Steal by Christopher Mason . A true story about the auction houses Sotheby’s and Christie’s and how they conspired to cheat their clients out of millions of dollars.

So thanks to everyone that participated. As with most polls of this nature, the rides that have been more ridden will get more upvotes. I wish I had a 2nd button where people could just say if they have ridden it or not, and then figure out a "winning percentage" but I have no such luxury. So keep that in mind when looking at the results that the best rides at the most visited parks will get voted to the top. Just for reference, in the spring we had a little survey which included a "which. Welcome to the new Razer Phone Themes Thread! I decided to update the thread a tad and keep more of an eye on it and updates too. I took a few hours of today and also decided to take screenshots of every single theme and take multiple screenshots of the theme. I know there are screenshots in the theme store itself but I feel that they are really lacking in actually showing you important parts of the UI. The list isn't complete as I reached my upload limit Greetings fellow Redditors, long time no see!

LAST UPDATED Sep 13th, 2018 \ Added some new 24/7 streams\ There is a TON of full adult swim shows that are readily available to steam on their website or elsewhere, and it can be crazy trying to find it all.

Hey folks, So with Tychus out as a Co-op Commander and his mechanics being based off of the old Confederate rangers group Heaven’s Devils, I thought people would appreciate a bit of a lore look into the history of the group and all the details they added. Since both Tychus and his merry band are pretty deeply intertwined, it’s easy to do both at once. I’ll also go into the metric ton of some of the cool references they added to his upgrades and kit. Added a TL;DR for the actual First of all, I wanted to say you have zero reason to listen to my opinions. This is just another Andromeda review, just like a million before mine. I'm also moving on from the Mass Effect universe after a fairly decent time investment. My ranking of the games in order of personal enjoyment: 1. Mass Effect 1, 44 hours, 20/49 achievements 2. Mass Effect 3, 38 hours, 21/50 achievements 3. Mass Effect 2, 40 hours, 50/62 achievements 4. Mass Effect Andromeda, 74 hours, 33/55 achievements </p>
